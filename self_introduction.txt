Hello everyone,
My name is Rishav Das. I am from Howrah, Glassgow City of India. Although it is also known as "Engineering Hub of Bengal". I completed my Madhyamik & Higher Secondary from Sanskrit Collegiate School which is standing upon it’s 200 years glorious journey since 1824. For higher studies I chose Swami Vivekananda Institute of Science & Technology to pursue my BTech degree on Computer Science. I want to learn and grow in this modern era of digitalisation. I am passionate to explore the intricacies of this online field to develop more useful things to human society. I love to invest my free time to be updated about this digital era. Earlier I was a national level martial artist, due to some financial issues I couldn't make it to the international level though I had qualified. I like sports but amidst all the sports I passionately love to play football. I also like arts and crafting. Let's embark our journey from here on together. Thank you for your time, it was a pleasure to talk to you.
